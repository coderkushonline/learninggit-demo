# learninggit-demo
This is my first git repo

I don't know what should I do.
I will become a pro in Machine Learning. Currently, I am a noob and learning github and git version control.
I also have to learn bash scripting and all the algorithms. Then I will also have to learning about MLOPS lifecycle.
